# Employee Management System
As the finale for my intermediate programming course, I had to build an Employee Management System. The project is focused on developing a dynamically linked list implementation in C, specifically designed to manage employee records for a project called "proFile." The key components of the project include:

Linked List Structure: The program  uses a linked list to store and manage employee data, storing each employee record in a node. The structure of the employee record includes fields like first name, last name, employee ID, dependents, and a pointer to the next employee in the list.

Menu-Driven Interface: The program provides a command-line menu interface that allows users to perform various operations on the employee data. These operations include adding, displaying, searching, counting, sorting, and removing employee records.

Functionality: The project implements separate functions for each menu option. The tasks include adding new employees, printing employee data, searching based on employee ID or full name, counting the number of employees, sorting the list, and removing one or all employees from the list.

Technical Requirements: The project emphasizes creating individual function files, a main testing file, and a makefile for compiling the program. It also has a specific folder structure for organizing the source, header, and executable files.
