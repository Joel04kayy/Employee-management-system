# Employee Management System
As the finale for my intermediate programming course, I had to build an Employee Management System. The assignment is focused on developing a dynamically linked list implementation in C, specifically designed to manage employee records for a project called "proFile." The key components of the assignment include:

Linked List Structure: The program will use a linked list to store and manage employee data, with each employee record stored in a node. The structure of the employee record includes fields like first name, last name, employee ID, dependents, and a pointer to the next employee in the list.

Menu-Driven Interface: The program will provide a command-line menu interface that allows users to perform various operations on the employee data. These operations include adding, displaying, searching, counting, sorting, and removing employee records.

Functionality: The assignment requires implementing separate functions for each menu option. The tasks include adding new employees, printing employee data, searching based on employee ID or full name, counting the number of employees, sorting the list, and removing one or all employees from the list.

Technical Requirements: The assignment emphasizes creating individual function files, a main testing file, and a makefile for compiling the program. It also requires a specific folder structure for organizing the source, header, and executable files.

Submission and Testing: The program must be thoroughly tested, and the completed assignment will be submitted to a GitLab repository. The submission should include all function implementation files, the main testing file, a header file, a helper file, and a makefile.

The overall goal is to create a robust and efficient tool for managing employee records using dynamic memory allocation and linked list data structures.
